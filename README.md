# Peer Review - DF for KC
Kay, you have put together a highly impressive analysis with accompanying visualizations. Your coding with use of advanced functions is particularly impressive to me and I learned a great deal reviewing your code. See the high-level review below:

## Points of Strength
1. You effectively advocate for open science with high quality research that is all openly available. Though our class is focused on data vizualizations, I think it's appropriate to highlight the fact that this kind of research is all-too-often hidden behind paywalls and inaccessible to the public. 
2. Your data tells a coherent and complex story, and you use visuals to compliment the viewer's comprehension of presented information. I particularly enjoyed how you lead the viewer down a linear path of socratic questions (e.g., questions that probe assumptions, such as "what if we didn't force linear modeling?") and mapped your answers on to producing visuals.
3. You effectively facet_wrap() figures to break out different traits or score ranges. I appreciated how you were able to do this without adding cognitive load to the viewer becuase your axes remained constant.

## Point of Learning
There were many points of learning, and the most relevant to coding was your integration of linear modeling for visualization. I have seen lm() used here and there, but you consistently used it, checked assumptions, and drew many models which was helpful for my learning.

## Areas for Improvement
To be completely honest, I felt as though I was a bit out of my element reviewing your code. You used sophisticated modeling which I'm just recently beginning to learn about. Therefore, my areas of improvement were mostly related to condensing code chunks and labelling visualizations. You can find suggestions in-line with your code, and accompanying comments, in the findings.rmd file pushed to Git.
